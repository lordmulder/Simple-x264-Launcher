Simple x264 Launcher - use 64-Bit x264 with 32-Bit Avisynth

1. Introduction
---------------

This program is a simple GUI front-end for the x264 H.264/AVC encoder.
Thanks to Avs2YUV, this program can use the 64-Bit version of x264 with
the 32-Bit version of Avisynth. This way you can keep on using your
favorite 32-Bit Avisynth plug-ins (e.g. DGDecodeNV) and still benefit
from the speed improvements of 64-Bit x264. Of course you can also use
64-Bit Avisynth, which is still considered experimental, if desired.
And of course you can use x264's built-in LAVF/FFMS input instead of
Avisynth just as well. Moreover this program provides full batch
encoding support. This means that you can run several encoding jobs in
parallel. Or you can let them run in sequence - one by one.


2. System Requirements
----------------------

This program runs on Windows XP with Service Pack 2 and later.
64-Bit Windows is highly recommended, but 32-Bit Windows works as well.
The CPU should support at least the MMX and SSE1 instruction sets.


3. Anti-Virus Warning
---------------------

Occasionally your Antivirus program may mistakenly detect "malware"
(virus, trojan, worm, etc.) in some of the files here. This is called a
"False Positive" and the files are actually innocent/clean. It´s an
error in your specific Antivirus software.

In case you encounter such problems, go to http://www.virustotal.com/
and check the file again with multiple Antivirus engines! And take care
with results like "suspicious" , "generic" or "packed". Those are *not*
real hits, they are just wild speculation.

Apparently Antivirus programs tend to suspect installers/uninstaller
created with NSIS. Furthermore some Antivirus programs blindly suspect
all UPX´d (packed) executables of being malware. Obviously this is a
stupid generalization, so you can safely ignore those warnings!

Last but not least: Always keep in mind that this is OpenSource
software! If you don´t trust the people providing the pre-compiled
binaries, download the source codes and compile them yourself.

DON´T SUBMIT ANY VIRUS/TROJAN REPORTS, UNLESS YOU HAVE VERIFIED THE
INFECTION WITH MULTIPLE ANTIVIRUS ENGNINES. THANKS!
